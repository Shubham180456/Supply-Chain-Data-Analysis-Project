## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes historical supply chain data for **DataCo Global**, integrating structured supply chain data and unstructured web access logs to provide operational insights into product performance, shipping times, late delivery risks, and customer behavior.

## **Objective**
- Identify patterns in sales, shipping times, and customer behavior.
- Detect anomalies in shipping times and late delivery risks.
- Correlate web traffic (product views) with sales to optimize operations.
- Use predictive models to mitigate late delivery risks.

## **Datasets**

### 1. **Structured Data**: (DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv)
- Contains records of supply chain activities, including sales, shipping times, and product categories.
- **Key fields**:
  - Sales per customer
  - Days for shipping
  - Late Delivery Risk
  - Product Category

### 2. **Unstructured Data**: (tokenized_access_logs.csv)
- Represents web access logs with product views and timestamps.
- **Key fields**:
  - Product, Category
  - Date, Hour
  - User IP

## **Key Analysis Areas**

### 1. **Sales Analysis**
- Visualization of total sales per product category, highlighting top performers like **Fishing Gear** and **Camping Equipment**.

### 2. **Late Delivery Risk**
- Analysis of late delivery risks by category, identifying **Golf Bags & Carts** as having the highest delivery risk.

### 3. **Product Views and Customer Behavior**
- Analysis of web traffic to determine which products are most viewed and when.

### 4. **Correlation Between Views and Sales**
- Correlation analysis showing how product views from the web translate to actual sales.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation

## **Results**
- **Top-selling products**: Fishing Gear and Camping Equipment dominate.
- **Late delivery risks**: Golf Bags and Pet Supplies show the highest risk.
- **Web traffic peaks**: Sporting Goods and Electronics have high views in September.
- **Predictive modeling**: Successfully predicts late delivery risks, optimizing shipping strategies.

## **Conclusion**
This project provides critical insights into sales performance, shipping delays, and customer behavior. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, DataCo Global can optimize operations, reduce delays, and increase profitability.
